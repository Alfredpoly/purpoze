#Purpoze Paracord Bracelets

Welcome to my GitHub repository where you can find a website to sell unique and stylish paracord bracelets handcrafted by me.

#About the Bracelets

Each bracelet is made with high-quality paracord and carefully crafted to ensure its durability and strength. I offer a variety of styles and colors to fit your personal style and preferences. From simple and sleek designs to intricate and colorful patterns, there's something for everyone.

#Repository Content

This repository contains the source code for my paracord bracelet website, where you can browse and purchase my latest creations. You can also find information on custom orders and how to get in touch with me.

#What I Learned

This was my first website, and I was learning how to use php, HTML, and other front-end languages. This sparked my interest in programming and launched my career.
